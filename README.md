# 📊 Data Analysis with Pandas

This repository contains hands-on data analysis projects using the **Pandas** library in Python. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), cleaning, filtering, grouping, merging, and visualizing real-world datasets like MovieLens.

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries

* Python 3.x
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn (optional)
* Jupyter Notebook

### 📁 MovieLens Dataset

* ✅ Merging movie and ratings datasets
* ✅ Extracting release years from titles
